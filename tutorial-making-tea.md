# Your first cup of tea – a tutorial

In this tutorial, we’ll go through the process of making a cup of tea. For a gentle introduction to the varied world of tea, we’ll make it a cup of Earl Grey black tea with milk and honey added to it for a smoother flavor. We’ll cover both where to get tea and how to prepare a cup of tea in your own kitchen. After you’ve had your first cup of tea, we’ll go over some options to consider when making the next cup.

For this tutorial, you will need:

- A kettle for boiling water
- A mug
- A teaspoon
- A kitchen timer
- Earl Grey tea
- Milk
- Honey

## Buying tea

At your local grocery store, find the tea section. Tea is generally sold at most grocery stores, and there will likely be a selection of different brands and types of tea.

Find an Earl Grey tea that is sold in a box of pre-measured, individual tea bags. There will likely be several options available: any one of them will work for this tutorial.

> Caution: Tea, especially black tea, contains *caffeine*. If you are sensitive to caffeine or if you are completing this tutorial late at night, consider buying a decaffeinated tea instead. If decaffeinated Earl Grey is not available, you can use a different kind of decaffeinated black tea.

## Making a cup of tea

In your kitchen, prepare the items and ingredients you’ll need for making tea: a kettle, a mug, a teaspoon, a kitchen timer, your tea, some milk, and some honey.

Check the tea’s packaging for instructions on how long to steep the tea, and set the timer. If there are no instructions in the packaging, you can steep the tea for 4 minutes.

Once you have completed these preparations, you’re ready to make a cup of tea:

1. Add enough water to nearly fill your mug to the kettle and bring it to a boil.
2. Place a tea bag into the mug.
3. Hold the tea bag’s string to prevent it from slipping into the mug. Pour the hot water into the mug, leaving room for milk.
4. Start the timer. When the timer goes off, remove the tea bag from the mug. The tea should be a rich brown-red color.
5. Add a teaspoon of honey to the tea and stir thoroughly.
6. Add a dash of milk to the tea and stir.

When the tea has cooled down slightly to a safe drinking temperature, enjoy your first cup of hot tea!

## Your next cup of tea

During your trip to the grocery store and while making your first cup of tea, you likely noticed that there are many options when it comes to making tea. If the cup of tea you had was not to your taste, you can try the following:

- Adding honey to tea helps balance the bitterness of some teas. If the tea was too bitter, try adding more honey. You can also leave out the honey, or try a different sweetener, such as sugar or agave syrup.
- Adding milk makes the tea creamier and helps balance the flavor. You can try different kinds and amounts of milk, or you can leave it out entirely.
- There are many flavors of tea. Try out different flavors to see what you might like. In addition to black tea, there are different types of tea, such as green tea and herbal tea, and each of them has their own characteristics. If you make green tea, note that it is steeped in a lower temperature than black tea.
